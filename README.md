# Project Title

Full Stack Assessment from Bayard Advertising

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

## How I Ran Tests

- Using XAMPP Control Panel, I ran an Apache and MySQL off of my local machine.
- I use fetch("http://localhost:3000/" in my index.js to connect my front end to my local backend.
- host: 'localhost', user: 'mysql_test', database: 'fs_test' from MySQL
- Running node app.js listens to port 3000 for backend
- Start Live Server on VSCode for frontend
- When making full validated inputs, submit POSTs to MySQL database
